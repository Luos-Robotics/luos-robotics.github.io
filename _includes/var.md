| Name | Description | Format |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **ID** | The ID is an unique number given to each module depending on their physical position. The system automatically assign each ID during the detection phase. If you move a module from a microcontroller A to a microcontroller B on a given robot, the ID will change. In the same way, if you change the wiring order of a microcontroler on the network on a given robot, the ID will change too. | Integer<br />e.g. `Id=1` |
| **TYPE** | The type defines the module purpose. A few types are predefined and can be used, or new ones can be created. The module type cannot be changed after module initialization. | String<br />e.g. `type=DISTANCE_MOD` |
| **ALIAS** | Alias is the name of the module. It is used to easily identify a module. Each module has a **default alias** who can be changed by users. For example, a module with the default alias `motor_mod` can be named `left_knee_motor` by user. This new name will be stored in the non-volatile memory of the board. As we do not want to have multiple modules with the same name, a duplicate name on your system will be automatically assigned with an incrementing number at its end, in the network. You can go back to the default name by setting a void name (`""`) to a module. | String<br />e.g. `alias="gate"` |' %}
