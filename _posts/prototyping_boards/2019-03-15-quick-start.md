# Getting started

Quick tutorials to get started with Luos products.

## Tutorial \#1
The following video shows a basic tutorial explaining how to make a LED and a servomotor be responsive to a potentiometer.

## Tutorial \#2

On the following steps, you will learn how to make a simple behavior with a LED board and a Button board step-by-step.

### What you will need
In the following example, we will make a LED turn on and off by pushing and releasing a button. You will need the following boards and accessories:

* 1x Luos LED board
* 1x Luos Button board
* 1x Luos USB board and an USB cable
* 2x Luos cables


### STEPS


#### 1. Configure your computer
The default tool we use to control a Luos network is a board hosting a Gate module, with a Python lib called Pyluos.

To begin, you have to install Python and Pyluos library, following the [pyluos documentation page]({{ "/pyluos.html" | absolute_url }}).

#### 2. Plug the boards together
Plug together all the boards with cables. You can plug them to any of the two connectors of each board, in any order.

#### 3. Connect the device to a computer
Plug the USB board to a computer with micro-USB to USB cable.

*In this particular example there is no high consumption component so we can use the power given by USB.*

Your device is now powered and connected. All the low-level code and electronics is ready to use to help you program your own behaviors.

#### 4. Interact with the device
*The USB node handle a specific module called "Gate". There are other boards hosting "Gate" module and using different connection than USB. These particular modules convert Luos modules data into something easier to understand and manage, using Json protocol.*

Interacting with the Luos system and program behaviors will require to spot the USB connection on your computer. The following steps are explained on the [General board use page]({{ "/" | absolute_url }}electronic-use.html) with more details. In the following example, the associated port is COM13.

Once you know the port, you can connect using:

```python
import pyluos
from pyluos import Robot
robot = Robot('COM13')
```
When Pyluos establishes the connection with a Gate module, it asks to run a network detection. This detection allows to discover all boards wired together on the network.

To list the discovered boards you can run:

```python
print(robot.modules)
```

In this tutorial, Python should find three boards, the Gate (USB), the LED, and the Button boards. You can check that all are detected:

`[<Gate alias="gate" id=1>, <Button alias="button_mod" id=2>, <LED alias="rgb_led_mod" id=3>]`

Knowing the alias of the boards, you can use them in your code.
To read values from a sensor, you just have to read a variable. For example, you can see the button state using this code:

```python
print(robot.button_mod.pressed)
```

Python will answer `True` if you execute this line by pressing the button and `False` if you don't.

The same way, you can control a board by setting variables.
In the following example we can control the led color using RGB values. Type and execute the following line:

```python
robot.rgb_led_mod.color = [50,80,5]
```

The LED turns on.<br />
Changing to the value `[0, 0, 0]` will turn it off.

More details are provided on the page <a href="{{ "/" | absolute_url }}electronic-use.html">Luos boards general use</a>.

#### 5. Write a simple beahvior
You can now write a simple behavior that makes the LED to turn on when pushing the button and turn off when releasing it.

```python
# Import libraries
from pyluos import Robot
# Establish connection with the luos network
robot = Robot('COM13')

# Use an infinite loop to put the behavior inside
while 1:
    if (robot.button_mod.pressed == True): # if the button is pushed
        robot.rgb_led_mod.color = [0,15,15] # Assigns a color to the LED
    else: # If the button is released or idle
        robot.rgb_led_mod.color = [0,0,0] # Turns the LED off
```

Test your behavior by executing the code.
