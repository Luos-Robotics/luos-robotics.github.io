## How to connect your servo-motor to your modules

The {{ board }} board has 4 servo-motor ports ordered as shown on the following picture, from `S1` to `S4`.

The {{ board }} board accepts supply voltage from `5V` to `7V`. Watch out to always power your motor with an appropriate voltage.

<blockquote class="warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> A USB board generally provides too weak power to drive a servomotor properly. It must be plugged to a Power plug board, for example.</blockquote><br />
