## How do the cables work?

The cables are used to link the Luos bords together. There are two lengths of cables : 10 cm (3.9 in) cables and 20 cm (7.9 in) cables.
However, it's possible to build a cable from any disired length (see the next section).

**Maximal current value:** The Luos cable can handle up to 7 A.

**Boards connection:** The connectors on the board side and on the cable side have a foolproof so that they can plug together in one way only. Fore more information about plugging boards together with cables, please follow [this link](/../integrating_luos/electronic-use#plug).

## How to buid a Luos compatible-cable?

If you need a cable with a length not available, you can build one, provided you have electrical wire and two connectors:

- Electrical wire: `AWG 22`
- Connectors: `DF11-8DS-2C, 2mm`

[The datasheet connector is available here.](https://datasheet.octopart.com/DF11-8DS-2C-Hirose-datasheet-15540170.pdf)

The board connector associated to the cables is `DF11-8DP-2DS`. this connector's pinout on Luos' boards is shown in the following picture:

The routing of the board connector is as shown below:

On a Luos cable, the wires are organized in this order:

- Pin 1 (first connector end) on pin 1 (second connector end)
- Pin 2 (first connector end) on pin 2 (second connector end)
- Pin 3 (first connector end) on pin 3 (second connector end)
- ...
- Pin 8 (first connector end) on pin 8 (second connector end)

> **Note:** If you wish to use only 4 wires instead of 8 (data only, no power), this is possible with using the pins 4 (`B_RS_485_P`), 5 (`A_RS_485_N`), 3 or 6 (`PTP`), and `GND`.
