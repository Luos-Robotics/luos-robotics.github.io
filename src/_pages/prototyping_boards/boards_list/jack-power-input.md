## How to use {{ board }} board

The {{ board }} board allows to power your Luos Network using a power Jack.

 - plug inner diameter : 2 mm
 - plug outer diameter : 6.4 mm

This board is not active, you can't detect it.
The {{ board }} board can provide 5V to 24V DC.

You can manage multiple voltage in the same network following Luos power rules defined in [Luos boards general use]({{ "/../prototyping_boards/electronic-use" | absolute_url }}) or by using a [power isolator board]({{ "/../boards_list/power-isolator" | absolute_url }}).
